# **Creating Our First Neuron**

## **What is a Neuron ?**

- Artificial neurons are the building blocks of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and are used to process and transmit information in machine learning and deep learning models.

## Let's Learn About Components Of A Neuron

- **Inputs** -  Imagine you have a bunch of friends, and each friend gives you a number. These numbers represent information or data. These are the "inputs" to our neuron.

- **Weights** - Now, each friend's opinion might matter to you more or less depending on how much you trust them. You assign a "weight" to each friend's input. If you trust a friend a lot, their input has a higher weight; if you trust them less, their input has a lower weight.

- **Bias** - You also have a personal bias. It's like your own opinion or mood on that day.

## How Does A Neuron Work

### STEP-1 
- You take each friend's number, multiply it by their respective weight, and then add up all these weighted numbers. This is like considering each friend's opinion but giving more importance to the ones you trust more

## STEP-2
- You also add a bias to the sum of the weighted numbers. This bias can make you more or less likely to accept the combined input from your friends

## STEP-3
- If the combined input (sum of weighted numbers plus bias) is above a certain threshold, you decide to take some action (like going to a party). If it's below the threshold, you decide not to take that action.
